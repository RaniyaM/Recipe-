## Overview
### Description
Tracks what RECIPE an individual wants to cook with any type of recipe.  Could be potentially used as a social app, or just meeting new friends with similar recipe tastes.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / FOOD
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features, it will use for a data of good recipe.
- **Story:** User will be able to find simple recipe on the app. User will be able to post new recipe for cooking
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or un often as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on food  taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a recipe sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with recipe.com, pinterest, or other recipe streaming applications.
